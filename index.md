This tutorial material consists of 21 modules of 15 to 45 minutes, for 2 full days in total. It covers some of the technical / practical aspects of controversy mapping with digital methods. As such, it is designed to complement teaching on the controversy mapping course.

**Goal:** learn how to harvest and explore data, formulate insights, and build relatable visualizations.

**Data:** we will mostly use Wikipedia data to keep things relatively simple, but the techniques generalize to other media platforms and datasets.

**Tools:** we will mostly use Tableau, Gephi, and [Jupyter Notebooks](nb/). No experience required.

## Overview

Each tutorial covers a part of this general process, from data harvesting (bottom) to building a controversy atlas (top). Once through all the tutorials, the routes on this map provide a set of options for completing the practical steps of a controversy mapping project.

## Schedule

The schedule breaks down in 4 half-days. Each one focuses on a different topic, and requires 4 hours of work, breaks included.

The activities must be done in order, as they build on each other and ramp up in complexity. Each one comprises instructions and a set of practical tasks. *Time is indicative.*
