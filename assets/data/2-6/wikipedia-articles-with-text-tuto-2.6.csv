Space-based solar power,"space-based solar power (sbsp, ssp) is the concept of collecting solar power in outer space by solar power satellites (sps) and distributing it to earth. the advantage of collecting solar energy in space is a higher collection of energy due to the lack of reflection and absorption by the atmosphere, the possibility of no (or very little) night, and better ability to orient to face the sun. space-based solar power systems convert sunlight to some other form of energy (such as microwaves) which can be efficiently transmitted through the atmosphere to receivers on the earth's surface. sbsp is considered a form of sustainable or green energy, renewable energy, and is occasionally considered among climate engineering proposals.  it is attractive to those seeking large-scale solutions to anthropogenic climate change or fossil fuel depletion (such as peak oil).
various sbsp proposals have been researched since the early 1970s, but none are economically viable with present-day space launch infrastructure. some technologists speculate that this may change in the distant future if an off-world industrial base were to be developed that could manufacture solar power satellites out of asteroids or lunar material, or if radical new space launch technologies other than rocketry should become available in the future.
besides the cost of implementing such a system, sbsp also introduces several technological hurdles, including the problem of transmitting energy from orbit to earth's surface for use. since wires extending from earth's surface to an orbiting satellite are neither practical nor feasible with current technology, sbsp designs generally include the use of some manner of wireless power transmission with its concomitant conversion inefficiencies, as well as land use concerns for the necessary antenna stations to receive the energy at earth's surface. the collecting satellite would convert solar energy into electrical energy on board, powering a microwave transmitter or laser emitter, and transmit this energy to a collector (or microwave rectenna) on earth's surface. contrary to appearances of sbsp in popular novels and video games, most designs propose beam energy densities that are not harmful if human beings were to be inadvertently exposed, such as if a transmitting satellite's beam were to wander off-course. but the vast size of the receiving antennas that would be necessary would still require large blocks of land near the end users to be procured and dedicated to this purpose. the service life of space-based collectors in the face of challenges from long-term exposure to the space environment, including degradation from radiation and micrometeoroid damage, could also become a concern for sbsp.
sbsp is being actively pursued by japan, china, russia, india, the united kingdom and the us.
in 2008, japan passed its basic space law which established space solar power as a national goal and jaxa has a roadmap to commercial sbsp.
in 2015, the china academy for space technology (cast) showcased their roadmap at the international space development conference. in february 2019, science and technology daily (科技日报, keji ribao), the official newspaper of the ministry of science and technology of the people's republic of china, reported that construction of a testing base had started in chongqing's bishan district. cast vice-president li ming was quoted as saying china expects to be the first nation to build a  working space solar power station with practical value. chinese scientists were reported as planning to launch several small- and medium-sized space power stations between 2021 and 2025. in december 2019, xinhua news agency reported that china plans to launch a 200-tonne sbsp station capable of generating megawatts (mw) of electricity to earth by 2035.in may 2020 the us naval research laboratory conducted its first test of solar power generation in a satellite. in august 2021, the california institute of technology (caltech) announced that it planned to launch a sbsp test array by 2023, and at the same time revealed that donald bren and his wife brigitte, both caltech trustees, had been since 2013 funding the institute's space-based solar power project, donating over $100 million.

history
in 1941, science fiction writer isaac asimov published the science fiction short story ""reason"", in which a space station transmits energy collected from the sun to various planets using microwave beams. the sbsp concept, originally known as satellite solar-power system (ssps), was first described in november 1968. in 1973 peter glaser was granted u.s. patent number 3,781,647 for his method of transmitting power over long distances (e.g. from an sps to earth's surface) using microwaves from a very large antenna (up to one square kilometer) on the satellite to a much larger one, now known as a rectenna, on the ground.glaser then was a vice president at arthur d. little, inc. nasa signed a contract with adl to lead four other companies in a broader study in 1974. they found that, while the concept had several major problems – chiefly the expense of putting the required materials in orbit and the lack of experience on projects of this scale in space – it showed enough promise to merit further investigation and research.

concept development and evaluation program
between 1978 and 1986, the congress authorized the department of energy (doe) and nasa to jointly investigate the concept. they organized the satellite power system concept development and evaluation program. the study remains the most extensive performed to date (budget $50 million). several reports were published investigating the engineering feasibility of such a project. they include:

resource requirements (critical materials, energy, and land)
financial/management scenarios
public acceptance
state and local regulations as applied to satellite power system microwave receiving antenna facilities
student participation
potential of laser for sbsp power transmission
international agreements
centralization/decentralization
mapping of exclusion areas for rectenna sites
economic and demographic issues related to deployment
some questions and answers
meteorological effects on laser beam propagation and direct solar pumped lasers
public outreach experiment
power transmission and reception technical summary and assessment
space transportation

discontinuation
the project was not continued with the change in administrations after the 1980 united states elections. the office of technology assessment concluded that ""too little is currently known about the technical, economic, and environmental aspects of sps to make a sound decision whether to proceed with its development and deployment. in addition, without further research an sps demonstration or systems-engineering verification program would be a high-risk venture.""in 1997, nasa conducted its ""fresh look"" study to examine the modern state of sbsp feasibility. in assessing ""what has changed"" since the doe study, nasa asserted that the ""us national space policy now calls for nasa to make significant investments in technology (not a particular vehicle) to drive the costs of eto [earth to orbit] transportation down dramatically. this is, of course, an absolute requirement of space solar power.""conversely, pete worden of nasa claimed that space-based solar is about five orders of magnitude more expensive than solar power from the arizona desert, with a major cost being the transportation of materials to orbit. worden referred to possible solutions as speculative, and which would not be available for decades at the earliest.on november 2, 2012, china proposed space collaboration with india that mentioned sbsp, ""may be space-based solar power initiative so that both india and china can work for long term association with proper funding along with other willing space faring nations to bring space solar power to earth.""

exploratory research and technology program
in 1999, nasa's space solar power exploratory research and technology program (sert) was initiated for the following purposes:

perform design studies of selected flight demonstration concepts.
evaluate studies of the general feasibility, design, and requirements.
create conceptual designs of subsystems that make use of advanced ssp technologies to benefit future space or terrestrial applications.
formulate a preliminary plan of action for the u.s. (working with international partners) to undertake an aggressive technology initiative.
construct technology development and demonstration roadmaps for critical space solar power (ssp) elements.sert went about developing a solar power satellite (sps) concept for a future gigawatt space power system, to provide electrical power by converting the sun's energy and beaming it to earth's surface, and provided a conceptual development path that would utilize current technologies. sert proposed an inflatable photovoltaic gossamer structure with concentrator lenses or solar heat engines to convert sunlight into electricity. the program looked both at systems in sun-synchronous orbit and geosynchronous orbit. some of sert's conclusions:

the increasing global energy demand is likely to continue for many decades resulting in new power plants of all sizes being built.
the environmental impact of those plants and their impact on world energy supplies and geopolitical relationships can be problematic.
renewable energy is a compelling approach, both philosophically and in engineering terms.
many renewable energy sources are limited in their ability to affordably provide the base load power required for global industrial development and prosperity, because of inherent land and water requirements.
based on their concept definition study, space solar power concepts may be ready to reenter the discussion.
solar power satellites should no longer be envisioned as requiring unimaginably large initial investments in fixed infrastructure before the emplacement of productive power plants can begin.
space solar power systems appear to possess many significant environmental advantages when compared to alternative approaches.
the economic viability of space solar power systems depends on many factors and the successful development of various new technologies (not least of which is the availability of much lower cost access to space than has been available); however, the same can be said of many other advanced power technologies options.
space solar power may well emerge as a serious candidate among the options for meeting the energy demands of the 21st century.
launch costs in the range of $100–$200 per kilogram of payload from low earth orbit to geosynchronous orbit are needed if sps is to be economically viable.

japan aerospace exploration agency
the may 2014 ieee spectrum magazine carried a lengthy article ""it's always sunny in space"" by susumu sasaki. the article stated, ""it's been the subject of many previous studies and the stuff of sci-fi for decades, but space-based solar power could at last become a reality—and within 25 years, according to a proposal from researchers at the tokyo-based japan aerospace exploration agency (jaxa).""
jaxa announced on 12 march 2015 that they wirelessly beamed 1.8 kilowatts 50 meters to a small receiver by converting electricity to microwaves and then back to electricity. this is the standard plan for this type of power. on 12 march 2015 mitsubishi heavy industries demonstrated transmission of 10 kilowatts (kw) of power to a receiver unit located at a distance of 500 meters (m) away.

advantages and disadvantages
advantages
the sbsp concept is attractive because space has several major advantages over the earth's surface for the collection of solar power:

it is always solar noon in space and full sun.
collecting surfaces could receive much more intense sunlight, owing to the lack of obstructions such as atmospheric gasses, clouds, dust and other weather events. consequently, the intensity in orbit is approximately 144% of the maximum attainable intensity on earth's surface.
a satellite could be illuminated over 99% of the time, and be in earth's shadow a maximum of only 72 minutes per night at the spring and fall equinoxes at local midnight. orbiting satellites can be exposed to a consistently high degree of solar radiation, generally for 24 hours per day, whereas earth surface solar panels currently collect power for an average of 29% of the day.
power could be relatively quickly redirected directly to areas that need it most. a collecting satellite could possibly direct power on demand to different surface locations based on geographical baseload or peak load power needs.
reduced plant and wildlife interference.

disadvantages
the sbsp concept also has a number of problems:

the large cost of launching a satellite into space.  for 6.5 kg/kw, the cost to place a power satellite in geo cannot exceed $200/kg if the power cost is to be competitive.
microwave optic requires gw scale due to airy disk beam spreading. typically a 1 km transmitting disk at 2.45 ghz spreads out to 10 km at earth distance.
inability to constrain power transmission inside tiny beam angles. for example, a beam of 0.002 degrees (7.2 arc seconds) is required to stay within a one kilometer receiving antenna target from geostationary altitude. the most advanced directional wireless power transfer systems as of 2019 spread their half power beam width across at least 0.9 arc degrees.
inaccessibility: maintenance of an earth-based solar panel is relatively simple, but construction and maintenance on a solar panel in space would typically be done telerobotically. in addition to cost, astronauts working in geo (geosynchronous earth orbit) are exposed to unacceptably high radiation dangers and risk and cost about one thousand times more than the same task done telerobotically.
the space environment is hostile; pv panels (if used) suffer about eight times the degradation they would on earth (except at orbits that are protected by the magnetosphere).
space debris is a major hazard to large objects in space, particularly for large structures such as sbsp systems in transit through the debris below 2000 km. collision risk is much reduced in geo since all the satellites are moving in the same direction at very close to the same speed.
the broadcast frequency of the microwave downlink (if used) would require isolating the sbsp systems away from other satellites. geo space is already well used and would require coordinating with the itu-r.
the large size and corresponding cost of the receiving station on the ground. the cost has been estimated at a billion dollars for 5 gw by sbsp researcher keith henson.
energy losses during several phases of conversion from photons to electrons to photons back to electrons.
waste heat disposal in space power systems is difficult to begin with, but becomes intractable when the entire spacecraft is designed to absorb as much solar radiation as possible. traditional spacecraft thermal control systems such as radiative vanes may interfere with solar panel occlusion or power transmitters.

design
space-based solar power essentially consists of three elements:
collecting solar energy in space with reflectors or inflatable mirrors onto solar cells or heaters for thermal systems
wireless power transmission to earth via microwave or laser
receiving power on earth via a rectenna, a microwave antennathe space-based portion will not need to support itself against gravity (other than relatively weak tidal stresses). it needs no protection from terrestrial wind or weather, but will have to cope with space hazards such as micrometeors and solar flares. two basic methods of conversion have been studied: photovoltaic (pv) and solar dynamic (sd). most analyses of sbsp have focused on photovoltaic conversion using solar cells that directly convert sunlight into electricity. solar dynamic uses mirrors to concentrate light on a boiler. the use of solar dynamic could reduce mass per watt. wireless power transmission was proposed early on as a means to transfer energy from collection to the earth's surface, using either microwave or laser radiation at a variety of frequencies.

microwave power transmission
william c. brown demonstrated in 1964, during walter cronkite's cbs news program, a microwave-powered model helicopter that received all the power it needed for flight from a microwave beam. between 1969 and 1975, bill brown was technical director of a jpl raytheon program that beamed 30 kw of power over a distance of 1 mile (1.6 km) at 9.6% efficiency.microwave power transmission of tens of kilowatts has been well proven by existing tests at goldstone in california (1975) and grand bassin on reunion island (1997).

more recently, microwave power transmission has been demonstrated, in conjunction with solar energy capture, between a mountain top in maui and the island of hawaii (92 miles away), by a team under john c. mankins.
technological challenges in terms of array layout, single radiation element design, and overall efficiency, as well as the associated theoretical limits are presently a subject of research, as it was demonstrated by the special session on ""analysis of electromagnetic wireless systems for solar power transmission"" held during the 2010 ieee symposium on antennas and propagation. in 2013, a useful overview was published, covering technologies and issues associated with microwave power transmission from space to ground.  it includes an introduction to sps, current research and future prospects.
moreover, a review of current methodologies and technologies for the design of antenna arrays for microwave power transmission appeared in the proceedings of the ieee.

laser power beaming
laser power beaming was envisioned by some at nasa as a stepping stone to further industrialization of space. in the 1980s, researchers at nasa worked on the potential use of lasers for space-to-space power beaming, focusing primarily on the development of a solar-powered laser. in 1989, it was suggested that power could also be usefully beamed by laser from earth to space. in 1991, the selene project (space laser energy) had begun, which included the study of laser power beaming for supplying power to a lunar base. the selene program was a two-year research effort, but the cost of taking the concept to operational status was too high, and the official project ended in 1993 before reaching a space-based demonstration.in 1988, the use of an earth-based laser to power an electric thruster for space propulsion was proposed by grant logan, with technical details worked out in 1989. he proposed using diamond solar cells operating at 600 degrees to convert ultraviolet laser light.

orbital location
the main advantage of locating a space power station in geostationary orbit is that the antenna geometry stays constant, and so keeping the antennas lined up is simpler. another advantage is that nearly continuous power transmission is immediately available as soon as the first space power station is placed in orbit, leo requires several satellites before they are producing nearly continuous power.
power beaming from geostationary orbit by microwaves carries the difficulty that the required 'optical aperture' sizes are very large. for example, the 1978 nasa sps study required a 1-km diameter transmitting antenna, and a 10 km diameter receiving rectenna, for a microwave beam at 2.45 ghz. these sizes can be somewhat decreased by using shorter wavelengths, although they have increased atmospheric absorption and even potential beam blockage by rain or water droplets. because of the thinned array curse, it is not possible to make a narrower beam by combining the beams of several smaller satellites. the large size of the transmitting and receiving antennas means that the minimum practical power level for an sps will necessarily be high; small sps systems will be possible, but uneconomic.a collection of leo (low earth orbit) space power stations has been proposed as a precursor to geo (geostationary orbit) space-based solar power.

earth-based receiver
the earth-based rectenna would likely consist of many short dipole antennas connected via diodes. microwave broadcasts from the satellite would be received in the dipoles with about 85% efficiency. with a conventional microwave antenna, the reception efficiency is better, but its cost and complexity are also considerably greater. rectennas would likely be several kilometers across.

in space applications
a laser sbsp could also power a base or vehicles on the surface of the moon or mars, saving on mass costs to land the power source. a spacecraft or another satellite could also be powered by the same means. in a 2012 report presented to nasa on space solar power, the author mentions another potential use for the technology behind space solar power could be for solar electric propulsion systems that could be used for interplanetary human exploration missions.

launch costs
one problem for the sbsp concept is the cost of space launches and the amount of material that would need to be launched.
much of the material launched need not be delivered to its eventual orbit immediately, which raises the possibility that high efficiency (but slower) engines could move sps material from leo to geo at an acceptable cost. examples include ion thrusters or nuclear propulsion.
to give an idea of the scale of the problem, assuming a solar panel mass of 20 kg per kilowatt (without considering the mass of the supporting structure, antenna, or any significant mass reduction of any focusing mirrors) a 4 gw power station would weigh about 80,000 metric tons, all of which would, in current circumstances, be launched from the earth. this is, however, far from the state of the art for flown spacecraft, which as of 2015 was 150w/kg (6.7 kg/kw), and improving rapidly. very lightweight designs could likely achieve 1 kg/kw, meaning 4,000 metric tons for the solar panels for the same 4 gw capacity station.  beyond the mass of the panels, overhead (including boosting to the desired orbit and stationkeeping) must be added.

to these costs must be added the environmental impact of heavy space launch missions, if such costs are to be used in comparison to earth-based energy production. for comparison, the direct cost of a new coal or nuclear power plant ranges from $3 billion to $6 billion per gw (not including the full cost to the environment from co2 emissions or storage of spent nuclear fuel, respectively).

building from space
from lunar materials launched in orbit
gerard o'neill, noting the problem of high launch costs in the early 1970s, proposed building the sps's in orbit with materials from the moon. launch costs from the moon are potentially much lower than from earth, due to the lower gravity and lack of atmospheric drag. this 1970s proposal assumed the then-advertised future launch costing of nasa's space shuttle. this approach would require substantial up front capital investment to establish mass drivers on the moon. nevertheless, on 30 april 1979, the final report (""lunar resources utilization for space construction"") by general dynamics' convair division, under nasa contract nas9-15560, concluded that use of lunar resources would be cheaper than earth-based materials for a system of as few as thirty solar power satellites of 10 gw capacity each.in 1980, when it became obvious nasa's launch cost estimates for the space shuttle were grossly optimistic, o'neill et al. published another route to manufacturing using lunar materials with much lower startup costs. this 1980s sps concept relied less on human presence in space and more on partially self-replicating systems on the lunar surface under remote control of workers stationed on earth. the high net energy gain of this proposal derives from the moon's much shallower gravitational well.
having a relatively cheap per pound source of raw materials from space would lessen the concern for low mass designs and result in a different sort of sps being built. the low cost per pound of lunar materials in o'neill's vision would be supported by using lunar material to manufacture more facilities in orbit than just solar power satellites. advanced techniques for launching from the moon may reduce the cost of building a solar power satellite from lunar materials.  some proposed techniques include the lunar mass driver and the lunar space elevator, first described by jerome pearson.  it would require establishing silicon mining and solar cell manufacturing facilities on the moon.

on the moon
physicist dr david criswell suggests the moon is the optimum location for solar power stations, and promotes lunar-based solar power. the main advantage he envisions is construction largely from locally available lunar materials, using in-situ resource utilization, with a teleoperated mobile factory and crane to assemble the microwave reflectors, and rovers to assemble and pave solar cells, which would significantly reduce launch costs compared to sbsp designs. power relay satellites orbiting around earth and the moon reflecting the microwave beam are also part of the project. a demo project of 1 gw starts at $50 billion. the shimizu corporation use combination of lasers and microwave for the luna ring concept, along with power relay satellites.

from an asteroid
asteroid mining has also been seriously considered. a nasa design study evaluated a 10,000-ton mining vehicle (to be assembled in orbit) that would return a 500,000-ton asteroid fragment to geostationary orbit. only about 3,000 tons of the mining ship would be traditional aerospace-grade payload. the rest would be reaction mass for the mass-driver engine, which could be arranged to be the spent rocket stages used to launch the payload. assuming that 100% of the returned asteroid was useful, and that the asteroid miner itself couldn't be reused, that represents nearly a 95% reduction in launch costs. however, the true merits of such a method would depend on a thorough mineral survey of the candidate asteroids; thus far, we have only estimates of their composition. one proposal is to capture the asteroid apophis into earth orbit and convert it into 150 solar power satellites of 5 gw each or the larger asteroid 1999 an10 which is 50x the size of apophis and large enough to build 7,500 5-gigawatt solar power satellites

safety
the use of microwave transmission of power has been the most controversial issue in considering any sps design. at the earth's surface, a suggested microwave beam would have a maximum intensity at its center, of 23 mw/cm2 (less than 1/4 the solar irradiation constant), and an intensity of less than 1 mw/cm2 outside the rectenna fenceline (the receiver's perimeter). these compare with current united states occupational safety and health act (osha) workplace exposure limits for microwaves, which are 10 mw/cm2, - the limit itself being expressed in voluntary terms and ruled unenforceable for federal osha enforcement purposes. a beam of this intensity is therefore at its center, of a similar magnitude to current safe workplace levels, even for long term or indefinite exposure. outside the receiver, it is far less than the osha long-term levels over 95% of the beam energy will fall on the rectenna. the remaining microwave energy will be absorbed and dispersed well within standards currently imposed upon microwave emissions around the world. it is important for system efficiency that as much of the microwave radiation as possible be focused on the rectenna. outside the rectenna, microwave intensities rapidly decrease, so nearby towns or other human activity should be completely unaffected.exposure to the beam is able to be minimized in other ways. on the ground, physical access is controllable (e.g., via fencing), and typical aircraft flying through the beam provide passengers with a protective metal shell (i.e., a faraday cage), which will intercept the microwaves. other aircraft (balloons, ultralight, etc.) can avoid exposure by observing airflight control spaces, as is currently done for military and other controlled airspace. the microwave beam intensity at ground level in the center of the beam would be designed and physically built into the system; simply, the transmitter would be too far away and too small to be able to increase the intensity to unsafe levels, even in principle.
in addition, a design constraint is that the microwave beam must not be so intense as to injure wildlife, particularly birds. experiments with deliberate microwave irradiation at reasonable levels have failed to show negative effects even over multiple generations. suggestions have been made to locate rectennas offshore, but this presents serious problems, including corrosion, mechanical stresses, and biological contamination.
a commonly proposed approach to ensuring fail-safe beam targeting is to use a retrodirective phased array antenna/rectenna. a ""pilot"" microwave beam emitted from the center of the rectenna on the ground establishes a phase front at the transmitting antenna. there, circuits in each of the antenna's subarrays compare the pilot beam's phase front with an internal clock phase to control the phase of the outgoing signal. this forces the transmitted beam to be centered precisely on the rectenna and to have a high degree of phase uniformity; if the pilot beam is lost for any reason (if the transmitting antenna is turned away from the rectenna, for example) the phase control value fails and the microwave power beam is automatically defocused. such a system would be physically incapable of focusing its power beam anywhere that did not have a pilot beam transmitter. the long-term effects of beaming power through the ionosphere in the form of microwaves has yet to be studied, but nothing has been suggested which might lead to any significant effect.

non-typical configurations and architectural considerations
the typical reference system-of-systems involves a significant number (several thousand multi-gigawatt systems to service all or a significant portion of earth's energy requirements) of individual satellites in geo.  the typical reference design for the individual satellite is in the 1-10 gw range and usually involves planar or concentrated solar photovoltaics (pv) as the energy collector / conversion.  the most typical transmission designs are in the 1–10 ghz (2.45 or 5.8 ghz) rf band where there are minimum losses in the atmosphere.  materials for the satellites are sourced from, and manufactured on earth and expected to be transported to leo via re-usable rocket launch, and transported between leo and geo via chemical or electrical propulsion.  in summary, the architecture choices are: 

location = geo
energy collection = pv
satellite = monolithic structure
transmission = rf
materials & manufacturing = earth
installation = rlvs to leo, chemical to geothere are several interesting design variants from the reference system:
alternate energy collection location:  while geo is most typical because of its advantages of nearness to earth, simplified pointing and tracking, very small time in occultation, and scalability to meet all global demand several times over, other locations have been proposed:

sun earth l1: robert kennedy iii, ken roy & david fields have proposed a variant of the l1 sunshade called ""dyson dots"" where a multi-terawatt primary collector would beam energy back to a series of leo sun-synchronous receiver satellites.  the much farther distance to earth requires a correspondingly larger transmission aperture.
lunar surface: david criswell has proposed using the lunar surface itself as the collection medium, beaming power to the ground via a series of microwave reflectors in earth orbit.  the chief advantage of this approach would be the ability to manufacture the solar collectors in-situ without the energy cost and complexity of launch.  disadvantages include the much longer distance, requiring larger transmission systems, the required ""overbuild"" to deal with the lunar night, and the difficulty of sufficient manufacturing and pointing of reflector satellites.
meo: meo systems have been proposed for in-space utilities and beam-power propulsion infrastructures.  for example, see royce jones' paper.
highly elliptical orbits: molniya, tundra, or quazi zenith orbits have been proposed as early locations for niche markets, requiring less energy to access and providing good persistence.
sun-sync leo: in this near polar orbit, the satellites precess at a rate that allows them to always face the sun as they rotate around earth.  this is an easy to access orbit requiring far less energy, and its proximity to earth requires smaller (and therefore less massive) transmitting apertures.  however disadvantages to this approach include having to constantly shift receiving stations, or storing energy for a burst transmission.  this orbit is already crowded and has significant space debris.
equatorial leo: japan's sps 2000 proposed an early demonstrator in equatorial leo in which multiple equatorial participating nations could receive some power.
earth's surface: narayan komerath has proposed a space power grid where excess energy from an existing grid or power plant on one side of the planet can be passed up to orbit, across to another satellite and down to receivers.energy collection: the most typical designs for solar power satellites include photovoltaics. these may be planar (and usually passively cooled), concentrated (and perhaps actively cooled).  however, there are multiple interesting variants. 

solar thermal: proponents of solar thermal have proposed using concentrated heating to cause a state change in a fluid to extract energy via rotating machinery followed by cooling in radiators.  advantages of this method might include overall system mass (disputed), non-degradation due to solar-wind damage, and radiation tolerance. one recent thermal solar power satellite design by keith henson and others has been visualized here. thermal space solar power concept  a related concept is here: beamed energy bootstrapping  the proposed radiators are thin wall platic tube filled with low pressure (2.4 kpa) and temperature (20 deg c) steam.
solar pumped laser: japan has pursued a solar-pumped laser, where sunlight directly excites the lasing medium used to create the coherent beam to earth.
fusion decay: this version of a power-satellite is not ""solar"".  rather, the vacuum of space is seen as a ""feature not a bug"" for traditional fusion.  per paul werbos, after fusion even neutral particles decay to charged particles which in a sufficiently large volume would allow direct conversion to current.
solar wind loop: also called a dyson–harrop satellite. here the satellite makes use not of the photons from the sun but rather the charged particles in the solar wind which via electro-magnetic coupling generate a current in a large loop.
direct mirrors: early concepts for direct mirror re-direction of light to planet earth suffered from the problem that rays coming from the sun are not parallel but are expanding from a disk and so the size of the spot on the earth is quite large. lewis fraas has explored an array of parabolic mirrors to augment existing solar arrays.alternate satellite architecture: the typical satellite is a monolithic structure composed of a structural truss, one or more collectors, one or more transmitters, and occasionally primary and secondary reflectors. the entire structure may be gravity gradient stabilized.  alternative designs include:

swarms of smaller satellites: some designs propose swarms of free-flying smaller satellites.  this is the case with several laser designs, and appears to be the case with caltech's flying carpets.   for rf designs, an engineering constraint is the sparse array problem.
free floating components: solaren has proposed an alternative to the monolithic structure where the primary reflector and transmission reflector are free-flying.
spin stabilization: nasa explored a spin-stabilized thin film concept.
photonic laser thruster (plt) stabilized structure: young bae has proposed that photon pressure may substitute for compressive members in large structures.transmission: the most typical design for energy transmission is via an rf antenna at below 10 ghz to a rectenna on the ground. controversy exists between the benefits of klystrons, gyrotrons, magnetrons and solid state.  alternate transmission approaches include:

laser: lasers offer the advantage of much lower cost and mass to first power, however there is controversy regarding benefits of efficiency.  lasers allow for much smaller transmitting and receiving apertures.  however, a highly concentrated beam has eye-safety, fire safety, and weaponization concerns.  proponents believe they have answers to all these concerns.  a laser-based approach must also find alternate ways of coping with clouds and precipitation.
atmospheric waveguide: some have proposed it may be possible to use a short pulse laser to create an atmospheric waveguide through which concentrated microwaves could flow.
nuclear synthesis: particle accelerators based in the inner solar system (whether in orbit or on a planet such as mercury) could use solar energy to synthesize nuclear fuel from naturally occurring materials. while this would be highly inefficient using current technology (in terms of the amount of energy needed to manufacture the fuel compared to the amount of energy contained in the fuel) and would raise obvious nuclear safety issues, the basic technology upon which such an approach would rely on has been in use for decades, making this possibly the most reliable means of sending energy especially over very long distances - in particular, from the inner solar system to the outer solar system.materials and manufacturing: typical designs make use of the developed industrial manufacturing system extant on earth, and use earth based materials both for the satellite and propellant.  variants include:

lunar materials: designs exist for solar power satellites that source >99% of materials from lunar regolith with very small inputs of ""vitamins"" from other locations.  using materials from the moon is attractive because launch from the moon is in theory far less complicated than from earth.  there is no atmosphere, and so components do not need to be packed tightly in an aeroshell and survive vibration, pressure and temperature loads. launch may be via a magnetic mass driver and bypass the requirement to use propellant for launch entirely.  launch from the moon the geo also requires far less energy than from earth's much deeper gravity well.  building all the solar power satellites to fully supply all the required energy for the entire planet requires less than one millionth of the mass of the moon.
self-replication on the moon: nasa explored a self-replicating factory on the moon in 1980.  more recently, justin lewis-webber proposed a method of speciated manufacture of core elements based upon john mankins sps-alpha design.
asteroidal materials: some asteroids are thought to have even lower delta-v to recover materials than the moon, and some particular materials of interest such as metals may be more concentrated or easier to access.
in-space/in-situ manufacturing: with the advent of in-space additive manufacturing, concepts such as spiderfab might allow mass launch of raw materials for local extrusion.method of installation / transportation of material to energy collection location: in the reference designs, component material is launched via well-understood chemical rockets (usually fully reusable launch systems) to leo, after which either chemical or electrical propulsion is used to carry them to geo.  the desired characteristics for this system is very high mass-flow at low total cost. alternate concepts include:

lunar chemical launch: ula has recently showcased a concept for a fully re-usable chemical lander xeus to move materials from the lunar surface to llo or geo.
lunar mass driver: launch of materials from the lunar surface using a system similar to an aircraft carrier electromagnetic catapult.  an unexplored compact alternative would be the slingatron.
lunar space elevator: an equatorial or near-equatorial cable extends to and through the lagrange point.  this is claimed by proponents to be lower in mass than a traditional mass driver.
space elevator: a ribbon of pure carbon nanotubes extends from its center of gravity in geostationary orbit, allowing climbers to climb up to geo.  problems with this include the material challenge of creating a ribbon of such length with adequate strength, management of collisions with satellites and space debris, and lightning.
meo skyhook: as part of an afrl study, roger lenard proposed a meo skyhook.  it appears that a gravity gradient-stabilized tether with its center of mass in meo can be constructed of available materials.  the bottom of the skyhook is close to the atmosphere in a ""non-keplerian orbit"".  a re-usable rocket can launch to match altitude and speed with the bottom of the tether which is in a non-keplerian orbit (travelling much slower than typical orbital speed).  the payload is transferred and it climbs the cable.  the cable itself is kept from de-orbiting via electric propulsion and/or electromagnetic effects.
maglev launch / startram: john powell has a concept for a very high mass-flow system.  in a first-gen system, built into a mountain, accelerates a payload through an evacuated maglev track.  a small on-board rocket circularizes the payload.
beamed energy launch: kevin parkin and escape dynamics both have concepts for ground-based irradiation of a mono-propellant launch vehicle using rf energy.  the rf energy is absorbed and directly heats the propellant not unlike in nerva-style nuclear-thermal.  lasermotive has a concept for a laser-based approach.

in fiction
space stations transmitting solar power have appeared in science-fiction works like isaac asimov's ""reason"" (1941), that centers around the troubles caused by the robots operating the station. asimov's short story ""the last question"" also features the use of sbsp to provide limitless energy for use on earth.
erc kotani and john maddox roberts's 2000 novel the legacy of prometheus posits a race between several conglomerates to be 
the first to beam down a gigawatt of energy from a solar satellite in geosynchronous orbit.
in ben bova's novel powersat (2005), an entrepreneur strives to prove that his company's nearly completed power satellite and spaceplane (a means of getting maintenance crews to the satellite efficiently) are both safe and economically viable, while terrorists with ties to oil producing nations attempt to derail these attempts through subterfuge and sabotage.various aerospace companies have also showcased imaginative future solar power satellites in their corporate vision videos, including boeing, lockheed martin, and united launch alliance.the solar satellite is one of three means of producing energy in the browser-based game ogame.
in the 1978 anime tv series future boy conan, sbsp enables the country of industria to develop geomagnetic weapons, more powerful than nuclear weapons, that destroy entire continents.

Thorium-based nuclear power,"thorium-based nuclear power generation is fueled primarily by the nuclear fission of the isotope uranium-233 produced from the fertile element thorium. a thorium fuel cycle can offer several potential advantages over a uranium fuel cycle—including the much greater abundance of thorium found on earth, superior physical and nuclear fuel properties, and reduced nuclear waste production. one advantage of thorium fuel is its low weaponization potential; it is difficult to weaponize the uranium-233/232 and plutonium-238 isotopes that are largely consumed in thorium reactors. 
after studying the feasibility of using thorium, nuclear scientists ralph w. moir and edward teller suggested that thorium nuclear research should be restarted after a three-decade shutdown and that a small prototype plant should be built.
between 1999 and 2022, the number of operational thorium reactors in the world has risen from zero to a handful of research reactors, to commercial plans for producing full-scale thorium-based reactors for use as power plants on a national scale.some believe thorium is key to developing a new generation of cleaner, safer nuclear power. in 2011 a group of scientists at the georgia institute of technology assessed thorium-based power as ""a 1000+ year solution or a quality low-carbon bridge to truly sustainable energy sources solving a huge portion of mankind's negative environmental impact."" however, development of thorium power has significant start-up costs. development of breeder reactors in general (including thorium reactors, which are breeders by nature) will increase proliferation concerns.

history
after world war ii, uranium-based nuclear reactors were built to produce electricity. these were similar to the reactor designs that produced material for nuclear weapons.  during that period, the government of the united states also built an experimental molten salt reactor using u-233 fuel, the fissile material created by bombarding thorium with neutrons. the msre reactor, built at oak ridge national laboratory, operated critical for roughly 15,000 hours from 1965 to 1969. in 1968, nobel laureate and discoverer of plutonium, glenn seaborg, publicly announced to the atomic energy commission, of which he was chairman, that the thorium-based reactor had been successfully developed and tested.in 1973, however, the us government settled on uranium technology and largely discontinued thorium-related nuclear research. the reasons were that uranium-fueled reactors were more efficient, the research was proven, and thorium's breeding ratio was thought insufficient to produce enough fuel to support development of a commercial nuclear industry.  as moir and teller later wrote, ""the competition came down to a liquid metal fast breeder reactor (lmfbr) on the uranium-plutonium cycle and a thermal reactor on the thorium-233u cycle, the molten salt breeder reactor. the lmfbr had a larger breeding rate ... and won the competition.""  in their opinion, the decision to stop development of thorium reactors, at least as a backup option, ""was an excusable mistake"".science writer richard martin states that nuclear physicist alvin weinberg, who was director at oak ridge and primarily responsible for the new reactor, lost his job as director because he championed development of the safer thorium reactors. weinberg himself recalls this period:

[congressman] chet holifield was clearly exasperated with me, and he finally blurted out, ""alvin, if you are concerned about the safety of reactors, then i think it may be time for you to leave nuclear energy."" i was speechless. but it was apparent to me that my style, my attitude, and my perception of the future were no longer in tune with the powers within the aec.
martin explains that weinberg's unwillingness to sacrifice potentially safe nuclear power for the benefit of military uses forced him to retire:

weinberg realized that you could use thorium in an entirely new kind of reactor, one that would have zero risk of meltdown. ... his team built a working reactor ... and he spent the rest of his 18-year tenure trying to make thorium the heart of the nation's atomic power effort. he failed. uranium reactors had already been established, and hyman rickover, de facto head of the us nuclear program, wanted the plutonium from uranium-powered nuclear plants to make bombs. increasingly shunted aside, weinberg was finally forced out in 1973.
despite the documented history of thorium nuclear power, many of today's nuclear experts were nonetheless unaware of it. according to chemical & engineering news, ""most people—including scientists—have hardly heard of the heavy-metal element and know little about it"", noting a comment by a conference attendee that ""it's possible to have a ph.d. in nuclear reactor technology and not know about thorium energy."" nuclear physicist victor j. stenger, for one, first learned of it in 2012:

it came as a surprise to me to learn recently that such an alternative has been available to us since world war ii, but not pursued because it lacked weapons applications.
others, including former nasa scientist and thorium expert kirk sorensen, agree that ""thorium was the alternative path that was not taken"".: 2  according to sorensen, during a documentary interview, he states that if the us had not discontinued its research in 1974 it could have ""probably achieved energy independence by around 2000"".

benefits
thorium is three times as abundant as uranium and nearly as abundant as lead and gallium in the earth's crust. the thorium energy alliance estimates ""there is enough thorium in the united states alone to power the country at its current energy level for over 1,000 years."" ""america has buried tons as a by-product of rare earth metals mining"", notes evans-pritchard. almost all thorium is fertile th-232, compared to uranium that is composed of 99.3% fertile u-238 and 0.7% more valuable fissile u-235.
it is difficult to make a practical nuclear bomb from a thorium reactor's byproducts. according to alvin radkowsky, designer of the world's first full-scale atomic electric power plant, ""a thorium reactor's plutonium production rate would be less than 2 percent of that of a standard reactor, and the plutonium's isotopic content would make it unsuitable for a nuclear detonation."": 11   several uranium-233 bombs have been tested, but the presence of uranium-232 tended to ""poison"" the uranium-233 in two ways: intense radiation from the uranium-232 made the material difficult to handle, and the uranium-232 led to possible pre-detonation. separating the uranium-232 from the uranium-233 proved very difficult, although newer laser techniques could facilitate that process.
there is much less nuclear waste when thorium is used as a fuel in a liquid fluoride thorium reactor—up to two orders of magnitude less, state moir and teller, eliminating the need for large-scale or long-term storage;: 13  ""chinese scientists claim that hazardous waste will be a thousand times less than with uranium."" the radioactivity of the resulting waste also drops down to safe levels after just one or a few hundred years, compared to tens of thousands of years needed for current nuclear waste to cool off. especially the production of minor actinides as well as of undesirable isotopes of uranium (particularly uranium-236 in conventional uranium powered light water reactors) and isotopes of plutonium (particularly plutonium-240) which are neither fissile nor fertile for thermal neutrons but which produce significant amounts of decay heat and which are major radiological hazards over hundreds of thousands or even millions of years. however, the production of activation products and fission products is broadly similar between thorium and uranium based fuel cycles.
according to moir and teller, ""once started up [a breeding reactor] needs no other fuel except thorium because [a breeding reactor] makes most or all of its own fuel."" breeding reactors produce at least as much fissile material as they consume. non-breeding reactors, on the other hand, require additional fissile material, such as uranium-235 or plutonium to sustain the reaction.
the thorium fuel cycle is a potential way to produce long term nuclear energy with low radio-toxicity waste. in addition, the transition to thorium could be done through the incineration of weapons grade plutonium (wpu) or civilian plutonium.
since all natural thorium can be used as fuel no expensive fuel enrichment is needed. however the same is true for u-238 as fertile fuel in the uranium-plutonium cycle.
comparing the amount of thorium needed with coal, nobel laureate carlo rubbia of cern (european organization for nuclear research), estimates that one ton of thorium can produce as much energy as 200 tons of uranium, or 3,500,000 tons of coal.
liquid fluoride thorium reactors are designed to be meltdown proof. a fusible plug at the bottom of the reactor melts in the event of a power failure or if temperatures exceed a set limit, draining the fuel into an underground tank for safe storage.
mining thorium is safer and more efficient than mining uranium. thorium's ore, monazite, generally contains higher concentrations of thorium than the percentage of uranium found in its respective ore. this makes thorium a more cost efficient and less environmentally damaging fuel source. thorium mining is also easier and less dangerous than uranium mining, as the mine is an open pit—which requires no ventilation, unlike underground uranium mines, where radon levels can be potentially harmful.summarizing some of the potential benefits, martin offers his general opinion: ""thorium could provide a clean and effectively limitless source of power while allaying all public concern—weapons proliferation, radioactive pollution, toxic waste, and fuel that is both costly and complicated to process."": 13  moir and teller estimated in 2004 that the cost for their recommended prototype would be ""well under $1 billion with operation costs likely on the order of $100 million per year"", and as a result a ""large-scale nuclear power plan"" usable by many countries could be set up within a decade.a report by the bellona foundation in 2013 concluded that the economics are quite speculative. thorium nuclear reactors are unlikely to produce cheaper energy, but the management of spent fuel is likely to be cheaper than for uranium nuclear reactors.

disadvantages
some experts note possible specific disadvantages of thorium nuclear power:

breeding in a thermal neutron spectrum is slow and requires extensive reprocessing. the feasibility of reprocessing is still unverifed.
significant and expensive testing, analysis and licensing work is first required, requiring business and government support. in a 2012 report on the use of thorium fuel with existing water-cooled reactors, the bulletin of the atomic scientists suggested that it would ""require too great an investment and provide no clear payoff"", and that ""from the utilities' point of view, the only legitimate driver capable of motivating pursuit of thorium is economics"".
fabrication and reprocessing is higher cost than using traditional solid fuel rods.
thorium, when irradiated for use in reactors, makes uranium-232, which emits gamma rays. this irradiation process may be altered slightly by removing protactinium-233. the irradiation would then make uranium-233 in lieu of uranium-232 for use in nuclear weapons—making thorium into a dual purpose fuel.

proponents
nobel laureate in physics and former director of cern carlo rubbia has long been a fan of thorium. according to rubbia, ""in order to be vigorously continued, nuclear power must be profoundly modified"".hans blix, former director general of the international atomic energy agency, has said ""thorium fuel gives rise to waste that is smaller in volume, less toxic and much less long lived than the wastes that result from uranium fuel"".

power projects
research and development of thorium-based nuclear reactors, primarily the liquid fluoride thorium reactor (lftr), msr design, has been or is now being done in the united states, united kingdom, germany, brazil, india, china, france, the czech republic, japan, russia, canada, israel, denmark and the netherlands. conferences with experts from as many as 32 countries are held, including one by the european organization for nuclear research (cern) in 2013, which focuses on thorium as an alternative nuclear technology without requiring production of nuclear waste. recognized experts, such as hans blix, former head of the international atomic energy agency, calls for expanded support of new nuclear power technology, and states, ""the thorium option offers the world not only a new sustainable supply of fuel for nuclear power but also one that makes better use of the fuel's energy content.""

canada
candu reactors are capable of using thorium, and thorium power canada has, in 2013, planned and proposed developing thorium power projects for chile and indonesia. the proposed 10 mw demonstration reactor in chile could be used to power a 20 million litre/day desalination plant. in 2018, the new brunswick energy solutions corporation announced the participation of moltex energy in the nuclear research cluster that will work on research and development on small modular reactor technology.

china
at the 2011 annual conference of the chinese academy of sciences, it was announced that ""china has initiated a research and development project in thorium msr technology."" in addition, dr. jiang mianheng, son of china's former leader jiang zemin, led a thorium delegation in non-disclosure talks at oak ridge national laboratory, tennessee, and by late 2013 china had officially partnered with oak ridge to aid china in its own development. the world nuclear association notes that the china academy of sciences in january 2011 announced its r&d program, ""claiming to have the world's largest national effort on it, hoping to obtain full intellectual property rights on the technology."" according to martin, ""china has made clear its intention to go it alone,"" adding that china already has a monopoly over most of the world's rare earth minerals.: 157 in march 2014, with their reliance on coal-fired power having become a major cause of their current ""smog crisis"", they reduced their original goal of creating a working reactor from 25 years down to 10. ""in the past, the government was interested in nuclear power because of the energy shortage. now they are more interested because of smog"", said professor li zhong, a scientist working on the project. ""this is definitely a race"", he added.in early 2012, it was reported that china, using components produced by the west and russia, planned to build two prototypes, one of them a molten salt-cooled pebble-bed reactor by 2015,: minute 1:37  and a research molten salt reactor by 2017, had budgeted the project at $400 million and requiring 400 workers. china also finalized an agreement with a canadian nuclear technology company to develop improved candu reactors using thorium and uranium as a fuel.
by 2019 two of the reactors were under construction in the gobi desert, with completion expected around 2025. china expects to put thorium reactors into commercial use by 2030. at least one of the 2mw thorium prototypes, either a molten salt reactor,: minute 54:00  or a molten salt-cooled reactor,: minute 44:20  is nearing completion, with startup in september 2021. as of 24 june 2021, china has reported that the gobi molten salt reactor will be completed on schedule with tests beginning as early as september 2021. the new reactor is a part of chinese leader xi jinping's drive to make china carbon-neutral by 2060. china hopes to complete the world's first commercial thorium reactor by 2030 and has planned to further build more thorium power plants across the low populated deserts and plains of western china, as well as up to 30 nations involved in china's belt and road initiative. see tmsr-lf1

germany, 1980s
the german thtr-300 was a prototype commercial power station using thorium as fertile and highly enriched u-235 as fissile fuel. though named thorium high temperature reactor, mostly u-235 was fissioned. the thtr-300 was a helium-cooled high-temperature reactor with a pebble-bed reactor core consisting of approximately 670,000 spherical fuel compacts each 6 centimetres (2.4 in) in diameter with particles of uranium-235 and thorium-232 fuel embedded in a graphite matrix.
it fed power to germany's grid for 432 days in the late 1980s, before it was shut down for cost, mechanical and other reasons.

india
india has the largest supplies of thorium in the world, with comparatively poor quantities of uranium. india has projected meeting as much as 30% of its electrical demands through thorium by 2050.in february 2014, bhabha atomic research centre (barc), in mumbai, india, presented their latest design for a ""next-generation nuclear reactor"" that burns thorium as its fuel ore, calling it the advanced heavy water reactor (ahwr). they estimated the reactor could function without an operator for 120 days. validation of its core reactor physics was underway by late 2017.according to dr r k sinha, chairman of their atomic energy commission, ""this will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, mostly imported, and will be a major contribution to global efforts to combat climate change."" because of its inherent safety, they expect that similar designs could be set up ""within"" populated cities, like mumbai or delhi.indian government is also developing up to 62 reactors, mostly thorium-based, which it expects to be operational by 2025. india is the ""only country in the world with a detailed, funded, government-approved plan"" to focus on thorium-based nuclear power. the country currently gets under 2% of its electricity from nuclear power, with the rest coming from coal (60%), hydroelectricity (16%), other renewable sources (12%) and natural gas (9%). it expects to produce around 25% of its electricity from nuclear power. in 2009 the chairman of the indian atomic energy commission said that india has a ""long-term objective goal of becoming energy-independent based on its vast thorium resources to meet india's economic ambitions.""in late june 2012, india announced that their ""first commercial fast reactor"" was near completion, making india the most advanced country in thorium research. ""we have huge reserves of thorium. the challenge is to develop technology for converting this to fissile material,"" stated their former chairman of india's atomic energy commission. that vision of using thorium in place of uranium was set out in the 1950s by physicist homi bhabha. india's first commercial fast breeder reactor—the 500 mwe prototype fast breeder reactor (pfbr)—is approaching completion at the indira gandhi centre for atomic research, kalpakkam, tamil nadu.
as of july 2013 the major equipment of the pfbr had been erected and the loading of ""dummy"" fuels in peripheral locations was in progress. the reactor was expected to go critical by september 2014. the centre had sanctioned rs. 5,677 crore for building the pfbr and ""we will definitely build the reactor within that amount,"" mr. kumar asserted. the original cost of the project was rs. 3,492 crore, revised to rs. 5,677 crore. electricity generated from the pfbr would be sold to the state electricity boards at rs. 4.44 a unit. bhavini builds breeder reactors in india.
in 2013 india's 300 mwe ahwr (pressurized heavy water reactor) was slated to be built at an undisclosed location. the design envisages a start up with reactor grade plutonium that breeds u-233 from th-232. thereafter, thorium is to be the only fuel. as of 2017, the design was in the final stages of validation.delays have since postponed the commissioning [criticality?] of the pfbr to september 2016, but india's commitment to long-term nuclear energy production is underscored by the approval in 2015 of ten new sites for reactors of unspecified types, though procurement of primary fissile material—preferably plutonium—may be problematic due to india's low uranium reserves and capacity for production.

indonesia
p3tek, an agency of the indonesia ministry of energy and mineral resource, has reviewed a thorium molten salt reactor by thorcon called the tmsr-500. the study reported that building a thorcon tmsr-500 would meet indonesia's regulations for nuclear energy safety and performance.

israel
in may 2010, researchers from ben-gurion university of the negev in israel and brookhaven national laboratory in new york began to collaborate on the development of thorium reactors, aimed at being self-sustaining, ""meaning one that will produce and consume about the same amounts of fuel,"" which is not possible with uranium in a light water reactor.

japan
in june 2012, japan utility chubu electric power wrote that they regard thorium as ""one of future possible energy resources"".

norway
in late 2012, norway's privately owned thor energy, in collaboration with the government and westinghouse, announced a four-year trial using thorium in an existing nuclear reactor. in 2013, aker solutions purchased patents from nobel prize winning physicist carlo rubbia for the design of a proton accelerator-based thorium nuclear power plant.

united kingdom
in britain, one organisation promoting or examining research on thorium-based nuclear plants is the alvin weinberg foundation. house of lords member bryony worthington is promoting thorium, calling it ""the forgotten fuel"" that could alter britain's energy plans. however, in 2010, the uk's national nuclear laboratory (nnl) concluded that for the short to medium term, ""...the thorium fuel cycle does not currently have a role to play,"" in that it is ""technically immature, and would require a significant financial investment and risk without clear benefits,"" and concluded that the benefits have been ""overstated."" friends of the earth uk considers research into it as ""useful"" as a fallback option.

united states
in its january 2012 report to the united states secretary of energy, the blue ribbon commission on america's future notes that a ""molten-salt reactor using thorium [has] also been proposed"". that same month it was reported that the us department of energy is ""quietly collaborating with china"" on thorium-based nuclear power designs using an msr.some experts and politicians want thorium to be ""the pillar of the u.s. nuclear future"". then-senators harry reid and orrin hatch supported using $250 million in federal research funds to revive ornl research. in 2009, congressman joe sestak unsuccessfully attempted to secure funding for research and development of a destroyer-sized reactor [reactor of a size to power a destroyer] using thorium-based liquid fuel.alvin radkowsky, chief designer of the world's second full-scale atomic electric power plant in shippingport, pennsylvania, founded a joint us and russian project in 1997 to create a thorium-based reactor, considered a ""creative breakthrough"". in 1992, while a resident professor in tel aviv, israel, he founded the us company, thorium power ltd., near washington, d.c., to build thorium reactors.the primary fuel of the proposed ht3r research project near odessa, texas, united states, will be ceramic-coated thorium beads. the reactor construction has not yet begun. estimates to complete a reactor were originally set at ten years in 2006 (with a proposed operational date of 2015).on the research potential of thorium-based nuclear power, richard l. garwin, winner of the presidential medal of freedom, and georges charpak advise further study of the energy amplifier in their book megawatts and megatons (2001), pp. 153–63.

thorium sources
thorium is mostly found with the rare earth phosphate mineral, monazite, which contains up to about 12% thorium phosphate, but 6–7% on average. world monazite resources are estimated to be about 12 million tons, two-thirds of which are in heavy mineral sands deposits on the south and east coasts of india. there are substantial deposits in several other countries (see table ""world thorium reserves""). monazite is a good source of rees (rare earth elements), but monazites are currently not economical to produce because the radioactive thorium that is produced as a byproduct would have to be stored indefinitely. however, if thorium-based power plants were adopted on a large-scale, virtually all the world's thorium requirements could be supplied simply by refining monazites for their more valuable rees.another estimate of reasonably assured reserves (rar) and estimated additional reserves (ear) of thorium comes from oecd/nea, nuclear energy, ""trends in nuclear fuel cycle"", paris, france (2001). (see table ""iaea estimates in tons"")

the preceding figures are reserves and as such refer to the amount of thorium in high-concentration deposits inventoried so far and estimated to be extractable at current market prices; millions of times more total exist in earth's 3×1019 tonne crust, around 120 trillion tons of thorium, and lesser but vast quantities of thorium exist at intermediate concentrations. proved reserves are a good indicator of the total future supply of a mineral resource.

reactor types
according to the world nuclear association, seven types of reactors can use thorium fuel. six have entered into service at some point:
heavy water reactors (phwrs)
advanced heavy water reactor (ahwr)
aqueous homogeneous reactors (ahrs) have been proposed as a fluid fueled design that could accept naturally occurring uranium and thorium suspended in a heavy water solution. ahrs have been built and according to the iaea reactor database, seven are currently in operation as research reactors.
boiling (light) water reactors (bwrs)
pressurized (light) water reactors (pwrs)
molten salt reactors (msrs), including liquid fluoride thorium reactors (lftrs).molten salt breeder reactors, or msbrs, use thorium to breed more fissile material.
high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (htrs)
fast neutron reactors (fnrs)
 accelerator driven reactors (ads)
