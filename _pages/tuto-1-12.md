**Duration: 45 min**

* Activate the knowledge you have just acquired
* Share your work with the other students

# Share your annotated networks

Your teachers will provide a Padlet where you can upload:

* Your annotated network of pages connected by hyperlinks 
* Your annotated network of pages connected by shared external references
* Your annotated network of pages connected to revising editors 

Spend 10 minutes reviewing and commenting on the work of other groups. Have they annotated the same stories as you? Have they made different choices? 

# Share preliminary ideas for your own project

Spend 20 minutes discussing what kind of networks you could make for your own atlas. Come up with a list of ideas. What kind of pages could be interesting for you on Wikipedia? What kind of stories would you hope to be able to tell through an exploratory analysis of these networks? 

Upload your ideas to the Padlet.

Spend 15 minutes reviewing and commenting on the ideas of other groups.
