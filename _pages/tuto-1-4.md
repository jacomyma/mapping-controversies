# Make a dashboard

This is not a tutorial, but an exercise. The task is to produce a dashboard with a new dataset, still on the same case. This time, you are on your own.

* **Import** the data into Tableau
* Produce visualization **sheets**
* Use them to make a **dashboard**
* Pick the **question(s)** you want to answer

# Annotate the dashboard

Like before, make an **annotated visualization** from your dashboard, by exporting it into Google Slides, adding information, then exporting an image.

# Documents produced

Keep somewhere, for sharing, the following document:
* The annotated visualization (JPEG or PNG)

# Next tutorial

‚òï Coffee time! Rest your eyes, then head for the next tutorial:
