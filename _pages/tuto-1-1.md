In this series of tutorials we will work with the issue of energy conversion. Energy conversion is [the process of changing energy from one form to another](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transformation). Wind turbines, solar farms, or geothermal power plants are all examples of energy conversion technologies. So are nuclear reactors and combustion engines. In other words, energy conversion technologies are key actors in controversies around climate change, sustainable transitions and zero carbon futures.
