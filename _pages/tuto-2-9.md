title: "2.9. Write the protocol: Annotated Scopus author-article network map"
---

**Duration: 45 min**

**Goals**
* Activate your knowledge by using the same Scopus data differently
* Extract an author-article bipartite network with **Table2Net**
* **Visualize** and **annotate** the network
* Write the **protocol**
* Compare to the previous visualization: do your findings match?

# Case

Still **Fake news** in the **academic arena**: we will analyze scientific publications.

# Data

Reuse the **Scopus** data from the [previous activity](../2.8/).

# Task

* Produce an **author-article bipartite network** with Table2Net
* Analyze it in Gephi
* Produce an **annotated network map**
* Write your **visual protocol**

# Bonus

If you are feeling comfortable enough, maybe you could try enriching your visualization by projecting semantic data as colors. Can you make it work? Is there something to see?

# Documents produced

Keep somewhere, for sharing, the following documents:
* The annotated network map (JPEG or PNG)
* The visual protocol (JPEG or PNG)

# Share your work

Your teachers will provide you with a Padlet where you can share your annotated network map and visual protocol. Upload before you go home and take 5 minutes to review and comment on the work of the other groups.

# WELL DONE!

ðŸ”¥ Congratulations for getting through all of this!

### Relation to the course readings

* The process of getting data through scraping, crawling and calling APIs is covered in **Chapter 6: Collecting and curating digital records** of *Venturini, T. & Munk, A.K. (2021). Controversy Mapping: A Field Guide.*
* The principles and concepts of Visual Network Analysis (VNA) are covered in **Chapter 2: What is visual network analysis** in *Jacomy, M. (2021). Situating Visual Network Analysis*
* And in **Chapter 7: Visual network analysis** in *Venturini, T. & Munk, A.K. (2021). Controversy Mapping: A Field Guide*

### Tools for getting similar data (networks in GEXF or GDF format) from other sources:

* Networks of users, hashtags, or emojis from Twitter with the [Twitter Streaming Importer plugin for Gephi](https://github.com/seinecle/gephi-tutorials/blob/master/src/main/asciidoc/en/plugins/twitter-streaming-importer-en.adoc). Takes a list of words/#tags or a list of users as input.
* Networks of YouTube channels or YouTube videos connected by their relatedness (as meassured by the algorithmic recommendations) with the [YouTube Data Tools](https://tools.digitalmethods.net/netvizz/youtube/). Takes a list of video or channel ID's as input.
