---

**Duration: 45 min**

**Goals**
* Activate your knowledge use the same Scopus data differently
* Extract an author-article bipartite network with **Table2Net**
* **Visualize** and **annotate** the network
* Write the **protocol**
* Compare to the previous visualization: do your findings match?

# Case

Still **Fake news** in the **academic arena**: we will analyze scientific publications.

# Data

Reuse the **Scopus** data from the [previous activity](../2.8/).

# Task

* Produce an **author-article bipartite network** with Table2Net
* Analyze it in Gephi
* Produce an **annotated network map**
* Write your **visual protocol**

# Bonus

If you are feeling comfortable enough, maybe you could try enriching your visualization by projecting semantic data as colors. Can you make it work? Is there something to see?

# Documents produced

Keep somewhere, for sharing, the following documents:
* The annotated network map (JPEG or PNG)
* The visual protocol (JPEG or PNG)

# WELL DONE!

ðŸ”¥ Congratulations for getting through all of this!
