**Duration: 45 min**

**Goals**
* Activate your knowledge use the same Scopus data differently
* Extract an author-article bipartite network with Table2Net
* **Visualize** and **annotate** the network
* Write the **protocol**
* Compare to the previous visualization: do your findings match?

# Bonus

If you are feeling comfortable enough, maybe you could try enriching your visualization by projecting semantic data as colors. Can you make it work? Is there something to see?

# Lorem Ipsum

# WELL DONE!

ðŸ”¥ Congratulations for getting through all of this!
