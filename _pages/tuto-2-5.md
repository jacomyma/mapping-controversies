title: "2.5. Do your own network from a category"
---

**Duration: 45 min + 45 min**

**Goals**
* Activate your knowledge
* Make your own network map from scratch: from **sourcing** to **harvesting**, **visualization**, **annotation** and **writing the protocol**
* Contribute to your project, at least as a test run
* Remember to take a break

# Task

It is now time to do that same thing on your own data set.

1. Choose a Wikipedia category
1. Source a list of its Wikipedia articles
1. Harvest at least 2 data sets (networks or CSV)
1. Analyze and visualize these data sets
1. Annotate your visualizations
1. Write the protocols

# Advices and comments

* **Help each other!**
* Check the **[list of notebooks](../nb/)**.
* Pay attention to the **quality of the sourcing** (the list of articles). The better, the easier the work of analyzing it: check that the articles are actually related to your topic.
* **What size** for the sourcing (articles list)?
	* Not too small, not too big: between 50 and 5000, but it also depends.
	* If the subsequent harvesting makes your data bigger, prefer smaller lists (max level low).
	* If not, you can probably visualize a network of thousands of nodes, and more (once you filter it).
	* If you have two, source multiple lists (same category, but at different levels).
* Prioritize **clarity** in your visualizations and visual protocols.
* If it makes more sense, you may present your protocols as a single diagram.
* **Take a break** at some point. You have a time slot of approximatively 1 hour and 45 minutes, including a 15 minutes break.

# Documents produced

Keep somewhere, for sharing, the following documents:
* The images of the network maps and data visualizations (JPEG or PNG)
* The image(s) of the protocol(s) (JPEG or PNG)
