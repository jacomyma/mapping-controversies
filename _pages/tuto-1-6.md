**Goals**
* Learn how to run a **Jupyter notebook** from Google Colab
* Check that it works differently from previous tutorial
* Make an annotated visualization from this data

# Open the Jupyter notebook in Google Colab

# Run the notebook to harvest data

Here is the list of Wikipedia articles they can use as input to recreate what they have done so far: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tcQd3iGjpRguQdmxIel1qM9JoM891OOO/view?usp=sharing

I am unsure how this will be different, though. Maybe we should actually give them a bigger list of articles this time to justify using a notebook? Here is a longer list with 139 articles about energy conversion technologies (level 0 from the categy, but we will get back to that later): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RKGhWNEUi1mC5oVBe6C8EQiO0euMhikQ/view?usp=sharing


# Make an annotated visualization
...this is where it gets important to have worked on a longer list (in order not to reproduce the same viz)


# Next tutorial

Last break before lunch! Then head for the last activity of the morning:

[1.7. Activate your knowledge about Tableau *45 min*](../1.7/)
