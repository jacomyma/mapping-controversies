# Make a dashboard

The dataset from the last tutorial ([1.2](../1.2/)) is rich enough to create a dashboard in Tableau. Let's do that by reusing the Tableau file of the last tutorial, and combining its visualizations.

How to create a dashboard:
* Click on the "New dashboard" icon at the bottom of the workbook.
* Drag the sheets you have created into the dashboard space: the timeline, geographical map, the list of editors... You may have to tune them.
* Check the [help](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/dashboards_create.htm#create-a-dashboard-and-add-or-replace-sheets) if you're lost.

# Explore the data by filtering the dashboard 

Filter the data and explore the result.
Questions to ask yourself:
