**Goals**
* Check a **new notebook**
* **Harvest** a bipartite network from a Wikipedia category
* **Write a protocol** that is more complex
* **Activate your knowledge** about notebooks and digital methods

# Datum

Category:Energy conversion
```

# Task

This is an exercise and not a tutorial, although it introduces a new notebook. You get how it works, now, so our instructions get less detailed. The gist of it is to produce and analyze the network you have already visualized in the [tutorial 1.9](../1.9/) (and basically once again in the [1.11](../1.11/)): articles and editors. "Repetition is the mother of all learning", they say.

This is what we ask you to do:
1. Harvest the articles of the category *energy conversion* with a max level of 1 ([üçâ&nbsp;notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jacomyma/mapping-controversies/blob/main/notebooks/Wikipedia_category_to_article_list.ipynb)).
1. With that list, harvest the bipartite network of articles and editors, using this notebook: [üçÑ&nbsp;Wikipedia articles to articles and editors network](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jacomyma/mapping-controversies/blob/main/notebooks/Wikipedia_articles_to_articles_and_editors_network.ipynb)
1. Make a network map in Gephi (no need to annotate)
1. Write the visual protocol in Google Slides

**Recommendation:** as we have seen in previous tutorials, you will need to **filter your network** in Gephi. Your filtering settings, as well as any unusual operation, must be **featured in your visual protocol**.

# Documents produced

Keep somewhere, for sharing, the following documents:
* The image of the network map (JPEG or PNG)
* The image of the protocol (JPEG or PNG)

Take some rest before the big chunk of the morning!
