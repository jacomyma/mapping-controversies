Get urls for the the 931 energy conversion articles here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KyJyrk17581ztcJrG4Xh5vsQ678uJx6f/view?usp=sharing

Upload them to SeeAlsology

Use these settings:
- "Distance": 0 (this will ensure that the tool only gets hyperlinks from the pages you input)
- "Parent links": Not selected (this will ensure that the tool only gets links from the pages you input)
- "Take all links": Selected (this will ensure that the tool gets all links found anywhere on the pages you input)
